#Â Lab 2: Nim ES

This code implements the game of Nim, where players take turns removing stones from a pile.
The player who removes the last stone loses the game.
The game can be played against the computer or against another player.
The number of stones in the pile and the game mode are chosen by the user at the beginning of the game.
The game ends when there are no more stones in the pile or when the player chooses to quit.
The code uses functions to handle different aspects of the game, such as displaying the game board, getting the user's move, and checking if the game is over.

Code written with the help of Giulio Figliolino, s317510, and Matteo Di Iorio, s316606.
