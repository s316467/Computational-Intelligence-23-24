# Set Covering Algorithm Exercise

This exercise focuses on the Set Covering problem, where the objective is to minimize the number of sets while covering all required elements. The methodology will delve into different algorithmic approaches and finally explore the A* (A star) algorithm in detail.

## Objective

- **Minimize the number of sets**

## Algorithms Explored

1. **Depth First**: This approach explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
2. **Breadth First**: It explores all the nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
3. **Best First (Greedy)**: Chooses the most promising node according to a specified rule or heuristic.

After exploring the above algorithms, we introduce the **A* algorithm**.

## A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm is driven by a heuristic, denoted as `H`. The features of this heuristic include:

- **Admissibility**: It never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal.
- **Monotonic**: The heuristic is consistent and satisfies the triangle inequality.

### Building a new `H`

When considering how to refine or modify the heuristic:

1. Consider the old `H`, which might be based on distances or any other relevant parameter.
2. Think about "special sets" that might have particular properties or significance in the context.
3. Contemplate the order of the sets and how it might influence the result.

## Instructions

1. Familiarize yourself with the basic concept of the set covering problem.
2. Implement and test the Depth First, Breadth First, and Greedy algorithms.
3. Dive deep into the A* algorithm, understanding the significance and usage of the heuristic `H`.
4. Experiment with different heuristics and observe how they influence the outcome.
5. Document your findings, especially any insights gained from manipulating the heuristic.
